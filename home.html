<h3><b>Maintaining your vehicle</b></h3>
<p><h4>Routine maintenance and upkeep can greatly extend the life of your car, truck or SUV. Still, many people wait until there are major issues before visiting a shop. Failing to properly service your vehicle can result in increased repair costs, as well as greatly reducing its value.</h4></p>
</p>
<p>
    <h3><b>Maintaining fluid levels</b></h3>

<p><h4>Having your fluids topped off is simple and can be performed in just a few minutes. These include: oil, radiator, transmission, power steering, windshield washer and brake fluid. Additionally, they can be flushed or changed as needed. Allowing many of these fluids to become dangerously low, or old, can cause serious damage to your vehicle.</h4></p>
